\section*{\centering{Introduction}}

The exponential growth of digital information has significantly increased the need for reliable and scalable cloud storage solutions. Usersâ€”ranging from students to professionals and small organizations require secure, accessible, and user-friendly platforms to store and share files efficiently. Traditional storage services can often present limitations such as restricted customization, complex integration with other systems, or high operational costs for small-scale users.\\

To address these challenges, this project proposes the design of a cloud-based file storage platform that enables users to upload, organize, and manage digital resources through an intuitive web interface. The system integrates authentication, access control, and metadata management to ensure information security and efficient retrieval. Moreover, it leverages cloud technologies such as object storage services and RESTful APIs to provide scalability and reliability.\\

This document focuses on the refinement and technical expansion of the design elements, together, these components establish the foundation for the database and system architecture design.
